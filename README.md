# Cloud_1
## Project description:
##### This is 42 programme's introduction to cloud services project.
##### In this project, students have to build a simple cloud infrastructure that must be able to:
    . Host a simple wordpress website.
    . Have a minimum of two server instances running at the same time at all times.
    . Randomly and evenly redirect visitors to any of the running servers.
    . In case of traffic piking, more server instances should be  automatically launched to accomodate this.
    . When traffic subsides, the server instances should revert back to two server instances.
    . A CDN should be used to distribute the static content.
    . New content should be available within a few seconds of uploading across all instances.
    . Your website should continue to be available despite any failures that might occur.
    . You should make sure that the public only has access to the stuff they are allowed to.
